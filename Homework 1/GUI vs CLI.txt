GUI (graphic user interface) and CLI (Command Line Interface) are two different ways users interact with computers. A GUI uses visual elements like windows, icons, and buttons, making it easier for beginners to navigate and perform tasks by clicking and dragging. In contrast, a CLI relies on text-based commands entered through a keyboard, which can be faster and more powerful for advanced users who know the correct syntax. While GUIs are more intuitive and user-friendly, CLIs offer greater control and efficiency for complex operations. A GUI is generally easier for users with accessibility issues but presents challenges across multiple types of access devices.
